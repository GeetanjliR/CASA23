### Correction

Corrections are required because the satellite imagery holds error from a variety of sources. These error could be from the sensor, the atmosphere, the terrain etc. The scan line correction (SLC) generated for a Whisk broom or spotlight or across track scanners to align the images. These could be possible via the method of regression by adding all of the vertical differences between the blue line and all of the residuals, it should sum to 0. Thus, they must be corrected as may be appropriate. In order to do that, the use of the imagery must be contextualize. Additionally, a linear regression is mostly used to model and then is re-sampled.

A **Geometric Correction** depends upon the given coordinate reference system, the remotely sensed data has collected image distortions can be introduced due to the view angle, topography, wind, rotation of the earth. It can be corrected as Ground Control Points (GPS) are identified to match known points in the image and a reference data set such as a local map, another image, GPS data from handheld device etc.

The second, **Atmospheric Correction (AC)** is required due to the sources of environmental attenuation, i.e., the atmospheric scattering and topographic attenuation. AC done to types of particle scattering for **Relative (to something)** is done in two ways, the DOS and PIF. The Dark object subtraction (DOS) or histogram adjustment, searches each band for the darkest value then subtracts that from each pixel. Where as psuedo-invariant features (PIFs) . **Absolute (definitive) Correction** requires to change digital brightness values into scaled surface reflectance. **Emprical Line Correction8** is an in-situ measurements taken using a field spectrometer that requires measurements at the same time as the satellite overpass. Next, applying the linear regression to the measurements against the satellite data raw digital number in the following equation.

The third is **Orthorectification correction / topographic correction** is needed due to imagery view angle taken at an angle can create such image distortion where georectification is giving coordinates to an image and orthorectification is removing distortions.

Lastly, **Radiometric Calibration** is done where a pre-calibration is required in a lab before a sensor is launched, it is then uses these measurements to adjust the data from the sensor. The image brightness and distribution as a Digital Number (or DN) gets captured by the sensors, converted to spectral radiance is the radiometric calibration.


### Joining data sets

To creates a seamless mosaic or image(s) the feather of images together is carried in Remote Sensing. The seamline is dividing line with a base image and "other" or second image with 20-30 percent overlap a histogram is extracted. Next, a histogram matching algorithm is performed which gives similar brightness values of the two images and feathering is conducted. **Enhancements** of imagery can be "improved/enhanced" based on the energy reflected and the contrast between features. There are other enhancements: NDVI, NBR Local enhancements: Edge enhancements: embossing, filter for example. **Principle Component Analysis** is a variance to remove of variables of dependence , Also used to creating group of similar variables such as social variables, environment variables

See Azimuth Angle animation solar zenith = angle of local zenith (above the point on ground) and sun from vertical (90째 - elevation) Spectral radiance is the amount of light within a band from a sensor in the field of view (FOV) Radiance refers to any radiation leaving the Earth (i.e. upwelling, toward the sensor. It could be also called Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance. Irradiance, is used to describe downwelling radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. Reflectance is a property of a material. Digital number (DN): intensity of the electromagnetic radiation per pixel, pixel values that aren't calibrated and have no unit, have light source, effects of sensor + atmosphere + material, values range from 0 - 255 (Lansat 5) = 8 bit or 0 - 65536 Landsat 8 (12 bit)
