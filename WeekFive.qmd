# WeekFive: Google Earth Engine (GEE)

## Summary

### Google Earth Engine: Setup
We covered the vector data use in EO pre-reading week and learned the SNAP and QGIS tools. A revolutionary understanding of Google Earth Engine tool enhanced my knowledge. The Earth Engine developed over Google tools capable of performing massive scale computation also known as planetary computer. Image object gets inherited from raster data with one or more bands and each band has its own name, data type, scale, mask and projection. Whereas features are vector data having geometry with attributes. Additionally, collection of several images or polygons are image stack and feature collections are feature stack (having multiple polygons). Thus, its  potential to compute ginormous processing, EE is supported by javascript that runs multiple parallel computations across CPUs, in fact on Google server also called as cloud computing. Moreover, GEE makes use of the Earth Engine Objects that starts with 'ee' in front using code that runs on server side and not client side (i.e. browser). Finally, the advantage of mapping over looping can be reaped in GEE as with loop the process iterates over and again making it a cumbersome process whereas mapping in GEE allocates processing across various machines with map.


### GEE functions and tools
THe second part of the lesson covered the functions and tools used in GEE. Objects i.e., vector, raster, feature, string, number are the building blocks of GEE. Where each of these belong to a class to be called by specific functions or methods or constructs of GEE. In turn it is required of GEE's geometric operations (e.g. spatial operations) of join, filter or zonal statistics. As its part of typical GEE operations, methods of machine learning, supervised and unsupervised classification, deep learning and exploring relationships between variables can be carried to bring applications/outputs in form of online charts, scalable geospatial applications, query data with user interface etc. As such object oriented learning GEE uses reducer object to compute statistics or perform aggregations. Reducers can aggregate data over time, space, bands, lists and other data structures in Earth Engine. Each reducer can take one or more input and generate one of more outputs. Reduce image can be done by by region or regions or neighborhoods (use of kernel). GEE provides advantage to access all imagery for multiple sensors for example to see the change over time in pixel values can deploy linearFit() with reducer function. This can be carried by including multiple dependent variables, the process is termed as multivariate multiple linear regression. Similarly, a join and filter operations can applied too.

## Literature Findings
When reviewed in recent research articles, it is evident both the study by Tamiminia, H. et al. and Amani, M. et al. inferred that the use of GEE is still evolving in the field of remote sensing ever since its launch in 2010. However, Tamiminia, H. et al. have brought a summary of algorithms and capabilities in term of packages that are available, such as machine learning, image processing, image collection, geometry-feature, reducer, charts and specialized algorithms to explore the setup of GEE application in RS (refer figure-1). On the other hand, the team of Amani, M. et al. describes the application of GEE that was used along with version 1 Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation products to study the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation in the Zambezi River basin. They further describe the use of Kendall's correlation and Sen's slope reducer that could investigate the precipitation trends and magnitudes by the processing of TRMM data from 1998 to 2017.They could interpret that “dry gets dryer, wet gets wetter” pattern in the study region. Additionally, they interestingly depicted in an info-graphics showing the distribution of use of GEE deploying regression, machine learning etc. methods in the first paper are as below in figure-2.

## Reflection
By now in week six, I am relieved of the tedious prolong application of RS as in week 3. Its parallel run of data storage, processing, application/ output delivery makes it convenient, quick and resourceful. GEE outperforms the earlier method of iteration and time consuming process in earth observation. The aggregation function providing a specific value to each pixel such as a median, linear regression, spatial join etc. manages effective and efficient image processing over planetary massive data, sets its fondness for me. Since I am crazy about data, it fascinates me to learn that EE archives historical imagery and scientific datasets going back to 40 years, including satellite data like Landsat, Sentinel-2, and MODIS, as well as geophysical, weather, climate, and demographic data. I feel more enthusiastic and engaging in remote sensing and geospatial data science studies.

In contrast, where most of the GIS analysis I have learnt in 'R', the use of GEE depends on the knowledge and skills of JavaScript and Python coding. Fortunately, we have been provided with the codes but its deployment to suit various other projects in future needs debugging and troubleshooting. It takes much time to figure out over online communities such as Stack Exchange etc. It make me question if we make use of medium spatial resolution imageries available from European Space Agency free of charge as GEE is a free of charge platform? In addition, what about the utility of high spatial resolution imageries available from commercial satellites that are expensive to purchase? The free Google platform to make use of EE is a good initiative but I wonder for how long. My experience in monetarily charges at the GEE page is so far, so good.
