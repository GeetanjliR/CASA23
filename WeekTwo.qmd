# Week Two

## Summary

In the first week, this portfolio has content about the basics of remote sensing cities and environment and the presentation learning in Xaringan tool. This week I learnt about the satellites and presentation tools as Xaringan (as attached below) and Quarto. Additionally, we learned how to create book in quarto.

## Application

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width='40%'}
xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(
  url = "https://geetanjlir.github.io/Presentation/",
  ratio = "16:9")
```

It was interesting to learn how use tools for learning dairy: 1. Xaringan (group presentation) and 2. Quarto (for individual).
