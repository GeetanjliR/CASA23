# WeekFour: Policy and Remote Sensing

## Summary

### Policy Application and Earth Observation Data

There exists a wide variety of EO data available for use. These data come from remote sensing sensors and depend on factors such as spectral bands, resolutions, and cost. Examples include multi-temporal land cover mapping, spectral signatures or libraries, change detection for urban or forest areas, vegetation stress detection for illegal logging, precipitation measurement, elevation models (such as LiDAR), temperature monitoring, night-time lights for urban development analysis, forest fire monitoring and prediction, pollution monitoring, drought indices, informal housing detection, water level monitoring, extraction of building or network outlines (polygons/lines), environmental monitoring (e.g., Aral Sea), and estimations of resources like forests, water bodies, snow, ice, and green space.

### Challenges in the State-of-Art-of-Policy-Making

The global policy documents outline the New Urban Agenda, focusing on standards and principles for urban planning, development, and management. Subsections 64, 65, and 67 address concerns specific to coastal areas, delta regions, and small island developing states. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 11, aim to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, with target 11.5 emphasizing data collection frameworks for disaster studies. RS and EO data are incorporated into targets 11.6 and 11.7, but their complex approach raises questions about target communities, replication, and usefulness of results. Metropolitan policy documents from cities like London, NYC, Cape Town, and Ahmadabad lack data specifications and applicability, while local planning authorities often focus on legislation and monitoring rather than prevention.

Remote sensing offers a systematic, data-driven approach to decision-making. For instance, in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR), which hosts over 71 million people, policies aim to manage physical growth and development pressures. Participating states are tasked with preparing sub-plans focusing on transportation, civic infrastructure, land use, and conservation. The NCR is divided into various policy zones, including NCT-Delhi, DMA, Rest of NCR, Highway Corridor Zone (HRZ), and Natural Conservation Zone (NCZ), to achieve these objectives.

## Application

The authors [@doi:10.1080/09715010.2019.1603086] K.S.S. Parthasarathy and Paresh Chandra Deka review the remote sensing and GIS applications in assessing coastal vulnerability and shoreline changes. They examine shoreline changes and the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI), offering valuable insights for the literature to identify critical parameters that significantly impact the coast in specific studies. However, the review article overlooks the application of remote sensing assistance to regional bodies in mitigating coastal vulnerability and shoreline changes.
Interestingly, [@sowmya2015] K. Sowmya et al. conducted a study on urban flood vulnerability zoning in Cochin City, situated on the southwest coast of India, using remote sensing in conjunction with GIS tools. They assessed vulnerability by employing a multi-criteria evaluation approach in a GIS environment, utilizing remotely sensed images, SRTM DEM, census details, city maps, and field studies. The researchers delineated flood vulnerability zones into categories ranging from low to very high vulnerability. They also calculated the proportion of area classified as very high and high vulnerability and examined the nature of vulnerability. However, their study leaves readers questioning how to implement remote sensing and GIS-driven analyses at the spatial level.


## Reflection

I liked the aspect where we continue to build on the knowledge gained from the previous module, CASA0005-GIS, and apply techniques like linear regression, spatial auto-regression (SAR), lag analysis, etc. It's evident that standalone remote sensing (RS) tools are insufficient and require integration with GIS tools. There seems to be a fragmented effort in terms of tools and techniques to address spatial problems, as reflected in the referenced articles in the application section. The discussion on different sensor data was particularly insightful, and the addition of InSAR learning to last week's SAR knowledge was beneficial.

Furthermore, the utilization of Earth Observation (EO) data seems to be overlooked in these efforts. Therefore, informed EO data policies and decision-making processes can help achieve goals and improve urban areas more effectively in a data-informed manner. To facilitate such learning, the professor designed a group exercise aimed at presenting a case study to the relevant government authorities. The objective is to propose one or more suitable remote sensing applications, along with pertinent data and details, to address pressing issues at the metropolitan level.
